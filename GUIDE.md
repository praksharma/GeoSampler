# GeoSampler guide

## Desktop foundation

Drag with the left mouse button to orbit; right-drag to pan; scroll to zoom.
Use the camera selector or the bottom-right orientation gizmo for standard views.
The reference grid is in the XY plane. Grid and axes can be hidden independently.
Reset view returns to the default isometric camera; it fits the loaded geometry.

Left: Geometry and Regions. Right: Properties. Bottom: optional Results pane.
Use View to show/hide panes; drag their titles to rearrange or detach them.
View → Reset layout restores the initial layout. Window geometry, panel layout,
and theme persist between launches. The Results pane starts hidden on first launch.

## Architecture

`geometry.py` runs Gmsh in a separate process, returning entity identities,
physical groups and per-entity display tessellation. Only `.geo` input is
currently enabled. Geometry is retained in the source file; display triangles
are not a substitute for exact geometry in future sampling.

`src/geosampler/app.py` owns the Qt window, menus, docks and settings.
`viewport.py` embeds Qt WebEngine and exposes a small QWebChannel bridge.
`viewport3d/` contains local Three.js assets, OrbitControls and the orientation gizmo.
No CDN is required. Structural models, solvers, supports, loads and force diagrams
from PyniteGUI are excluded. Keep future CAD and sampling services independent of Qt.

## Agreed product scope

- CAD contains the faces/edges needed to distinguish boundary-condition regions.
- Users label one or more existing entities per region; labels are metadata.
- No CAD editing, boundary partitioning, BC-value assignment, or PDE solver.
- Sample interiors and individual boundary regions; include normals where applicable.
- Primary Python interface: xarray Dataset, persisted as NetCDF. Alternative: named
  NumPy arrays in NPZ. No Parquet. Final dataset schema remains to be implemented.
- Preserve seeds, geometry references and sampling settings for reproducibility.
- Validate containment, surface distributions, normals, and labels before release.

## Development validation

```sh
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
uv build
```

The smoke test uses the real WebEngine viewport, checks renderer readiness,
camera changes, theme updates, dock persistence, and graphics errors. Run with a
desktop display; the test selects software rendering. Headless backend support
depends on the host graphics stack.
Check an interactive launch for orbit, zoom, pan, gizmo clicks and dock dragging.

## Provenance

See THIRD_PARTY.md for the source revision and retained licences. roadmap.txt is
the original planning reference; README, this guide and TODO describe current scope.

## Foundation validation record

Validated on 2026-10-10 with Python 3.12 and PySide6 6.12: real WebEngine
startup, camera/bridge response, pane visibility and persistence, and theme
settings passed on Wayland using software rendering. The initial window was
visually inspected. Source and wheel distributions built successfully. This host
emits graphics-driver warnings; its offscreen and X11 paths were not usable.
Interactive mouse gestures and other operating systems still need manual checks.

## Geometry import and selection

Open a `.geo` file with File → Open Geometry, or pass its path on the command
line. Import runs outside the UI process; a failed import retains the previous
model. Closing the window stops an active import. File replacement clears old
selections. Face and edge IDs are scoped to the loaded document.

Select faces (F) uses a crosshair cursor; Select edges (E) uses a cell cursor.
Switching modes clears selection. Click selects one entity; Ctrl/Shift-click
toggles additional entities; clicking empty space or Esc clears selection.
Dragging orbits without selecting. The geometry tree can also select entities
and automatically switches to their face/edge mode. Properties shows IDs,
geometry types and imported physical group IDs. Imported groups are read-only.

Hover is teal; selection is orange. Edge hover uses a 4-pixel stroke and
selected edges use a 6-pixel stroke, maintaining their screen width while
zooming. Ordinary edges remain thin. Surface triangles map to original faces;
only original geometry edges participate in edge selection. Edges hidden behind
nearer faces are filtered using a depth tolerance. Edge picking uses an approximate
six-pixel tolerance at camera target depth. Region editing and hide/isolate tools
are not implemented yet. No training points or volume mesh are generated.

Display tessellation follows the source geometry's surface meshing settings;
coarse inputs may look faceted. It is not a sampling accuracy guarantee.

Validation includes asynchronous import of both reference files, face clicks,
annulus hole rejection, edge clicks and multi-selection, tree synchronization,
file replacement, import failure preservation, and drag suppression. The real
Qt WebEngine renderer and QWebChannel bridge are exercised on Wayland.

## NVIDIA rendering on Linux/Wayland

Normal launches automatically apply the NVIDIA workaround inherited from
PyniteGUI when one NVIDIA GPU drives the connected display: Qt Vulkan backend,
NVIDIA EGL/Vulkan driver selection, and exclusion of Mesa Vulkan layers. These
settings apply only to this application process and respect existing graphics
environment overrides. Do not pass `--software-rendering` for GPU rendering.

PySide6 is pinned to 6.11.2, matching PyniteGUI. On this host, Qt 6.12 stalled
with the automatic NVIDIA setup, while 6.11.2 successfully reported
`ANGLE (NVIDIA Corporation, Quadro RTX 4000/PCIe/SSE2, OpenGL ES 3.2)` through
the actual WebGL context. Check Help → Graphics information for the observed
renderer. The software fallback remains available for other machines.
